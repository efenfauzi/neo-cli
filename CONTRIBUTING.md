# Contributing to NEO CLI

We'd be happy for you to contribute to NEO CLI.

## Project organization

* Branch `master` is always stable and release-ready.
* Branch `dev` is for development and merged into `master` when stable.
* Feature branches should be created for adding new features and merged into `dev` when ready.
* Bug fix branches should be created for fixing bugs and merged into
  `dev` when ready.

## Opening a new issue

1. Look through existing issues to see if your issue already
   exists. **So we don't have duplicate issue**.
2. If your issue already exists, comment on its thread with any information you have. Even if this is simply to note that you are having the same problem, it is still helpful!
3. Always *be as descriptive as you can*.
4. What is the expected behavior? What is the actual behavior? What are the steps to reproduce?
5. Attach screenshots, videos, GIFs if possible.
6. **Include NEO CLI version or branch experiencing the issue.**
7. **Include OS version experiencing the issue.**


## Submitting a pull request

1. Find an issue to work on, or create a new one. *Avoid duplicates, please check existing issues!*
2. Fork the repo, or make sure you are synced with the latest changes on `dev`.
3. Create a new branch with a sweet name: `git checkout -b issue_<##>_<description>`.
4. Do code.
5. Write unit tests when applicable.
6. Keep your code nice and clean by adhering to the coding standards & guidelines below.
7. Don't break unit tests or functionality.
8. Update the documentation header comments if needed.
9. **Rebase on `dev` branch and resolve any conflicts _before submitting a pull request!_**
10. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch.
